            The difference between good photos and beautiful photos <br />
            Good photos tell stories. Average photos are just beautiful
          </p>

          <p>
            A truly good picture does not only show something but it lights up a
            perceptual space in the head of the observer. It can’t be contained
            into the two dimensions of a print but it always tries to get out.
            It wants to go beyond the two dimensions into the physical space. A
            good picture can’t be just a nice thing.
